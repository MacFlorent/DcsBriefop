## Concept
DcsBriefop is a tool to help DCS mission makers to efficiently create and maintain the kneeboard pages that document their missions.
The program allows the user to combine and organise the mission data in kneeboard folders. Target coordinates, weather information, waypoint altitudes, radio and radionav frequencies and more are read directly from the mission file and used to build the kneeboard, then inject it back in the mission file.

In addition to the data available in the mission, DcsBriefop manages additional custom informations such as comments, map markers, custom radio or tacans, etc.

DcsBriefop works with the static data of a DCS miz file, and as such cannot intepret and use dynam
